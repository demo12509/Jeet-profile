        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Passionate about the intersection of technology and innovation, I am a first-year Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at UEMK. My journey into the world of AI began with a fascination for problem-solving and a desire to create intelligent systems that enhance everyday life. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can share ideas and learn from others. Currently, I am diving into foundational programming languages, algorithms, and machine learning principles, eager to explore their real-world applications. Outside the classroom, I engage in coding projects and participate in hackathons to sharpen my skills and connect with like-minded peers. With a strong commitment to continuous learning and a curiosity that drives me, I aim to contribute to innovative AI solutions that make a meaningful impact. Always excited about new challenges, I look forward to shaping the future of technology through creativity and dedication.</p>
